# Image_Repository-JAVA-JDBC-JAVAFX

Image Repository is a Java based project which uses JDBC (Java Database Connection) to connect to the database and JavaFX to create a GUI (Graphical User Interface).

Using the gui, you can connect to any MySQL database you want, given you have the username and password to connect to it. Connecting to the database also creates a table "images" with three columns ("IMAGE_ID", "IMAGE", "IMAGE_CAPTION"). You can then add one/bulk/enormous amount of pictures to the database.

This is an individual project.
